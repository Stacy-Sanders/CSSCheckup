    <h3>In the beginning</h3>
    <p class="wolverine">I was in my twenties the first time I realized I wanted to learn coding. I purchased a book about Scheme with an elephant on the front. I was lost from the first page.</p>

    <h3>And then there was college.</h3>
    <p class="wolverine">I decided Computer Science was the way to go. I sat in my introductory course and everyone already knew binary. I felt lost. </p>

    <h3>Hello World</h3>
    <p class="wolverine">A former flame was learning Python for a course at DeVry, and I bought the book to learn along with him. I really enjoyed it, but wasn't quite able to teach myself.</p>

        <h1 id="Still-learning">But this time is different!</h1>
        <p  id="you-can-do-it"> I am so excited to begin at Eleven Fifty Academy. I look forward to jump starting a new career that I was previously too scared to pursue.</p>
